🦟 Mosquito Population Analysis

Author: Jillian Higbee

Overview

This project analyzes experimental data from wet-lab research on Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to examine population dynamics, fitness, and resistance under controlled laboratory conditions. The analysis explores trends in mortality, development, and population structure using Python-based data analysis and visualization.

This was my first-ever coding project, completed as part of my early transition from wet-lab biology into computational analysis. The goal of this project was not only to analyze biological data, but also to learn how to structure data, ask quantitative questions, and translate experimental results into interpretable insights using code.

Biological Context

Aedes aegypti is a key vector for several human diseases. Understanding how population density, resistance, and environmental conditions affect mosquito fitness is essential for informing vector control strategies.

In this study, mosquitoes were reared from larvae to adults under controlled laboratory conditions. Population metrics such as mortality, development rate, and sex ratios were recorded and organized into structured datasets for analysis.

Research Questions

How do population density and experimental conditions influence mosquito survival and development?

Are there observable trends in mortality or population structure across experimental groups?

How can experimental mosquito data be effectively organized and analyzed computationally?

Methods

Data Collection: Experimental data collected during wet-lab research, including population counts and developmental outcomes.

Data Processing: Raw experimental data were manually organized into structured tabular formats.

Analysis & Visualization: Python was used to explore trends, summarize results, and generate visualizations to aid interpretation.

This project was developed using exploratory data analysis techniques and emphasizes clarity and biological interpretation over algorithmic complexity.

Tools & Technologies

Python

Jupyter Notebook

pandas for data manipulation

matplotlib / seaborn for visualization

Key Outcomes

Successfully converted wet-lab experimental data into structured datasets suitable for computational analysis.

Identified trends in mosquito population fitness and survival across experimental conditions.

Developed foundational skills in Python, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis.

What I Learned

As my first coding project, this work was a major learning experience. Through this project, I learned how to:

Translate biological questions into computational workflows

Organize and clean experimental data for analysis

Use Python libraries to explore and visualize biological datasets

Debug code and iteratively improve analyses

Most importantly, this project motivated my continued interest in computational biology and bioinformatics by showing how coding can scale and deepen biological research.

Limitations & Future Directions

This analysis is exploratory and based on a limited experimental dataset.

Future work could include statistical modeling, reproducible pipelines, and integration with larger or high-throughput datasets.

With additional training, this project could be expanded using R, command-line tools, and more formal bioinformatics workflows.

Relevance to Bioinformatics

This project represents the starting point of my transition from wet-lab biology to computational biology. It laid the foundation for my continued development in data analysis, programming, and bioinformatics, and directly motivated my pursuit of more advanced computational projects involving genomics and protein structure analysis.
